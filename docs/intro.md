# Installation
The module can be used both in Studio and using a external text editor using Rojo.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="1" label="Roblox Studio" default>

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/lettuce-magician/Stir/releases) page in the github repository
2. Download the **model file** (a file ending in `.rbxm`).
3. After downloading it, drag 'n' drop it in Studio and insert the modules in anywhere you want (just make sure they are always toghter).

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="2" label="Wally (Rojo/External Editor)">

An installation method with the [Wally Package Manager](https://wally.run) has to still be done, please be patient.
*(Note: Yes you're able to download it through wally at lettuce-magician/Stir, however it has useless files, and since i'm still figuring out how it works, pardon for my stupidity :P)*

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
